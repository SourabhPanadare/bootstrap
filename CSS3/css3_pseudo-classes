# Link Pseudo-classes:- The :link and :visited pseudo-classes define if a link has or hasn’t been visited.

	a:link {...}     :- To style an anchor which has not been visited
	a:visited {...}  :- styles links that a user has already visited

# Action Pseudo-classes:- Based on a users’ actions different pseudo-classes may be dynamically applied to an element

	a:hover {...}    :- applied to an element when a user moves their cursor over the element
	a:active {...}   :- applied to an element when a user engages an element, such as clicking on an 					    element. 
	a:focus {...}    :- often by using the keyboard to tab from one element to another.

# State Pseudo-classes:- Generated around the user interface state of elements, particularly within form elements.

	input:enabled {...}        :- selects an input that is in the default state of enabled
	input:disabled {...}       :- selects an input that has the disabled attribute tied to it

	input:checked {...}        :- selects checkboxes or radio buttons that are, as you may expect, 									  checked. 
	input:indeterminate {...}  :- When a checkbox or radio button has neither been selected nor unselected 								 it lives in an indeterminate state

# Structural Pseudo-class:-  These structural and position based pseudo-classes come in a few different shapes and sizes, each of which provides their own unique function.

	## :first-child, :last-child 

	   li:first-child {...}    :- identifies the first list item within a list 
	   li:last-child {...}     :- identifies the last list item within a list

	## :nth-child(n), :nth-last-child(n)

		li:nth-child(2n+3)  :-     Selects an element that matches the given number,from begining of 							   document
		li:nth-last-child(3n+2):-  Selects an element that matches the given number or expression, from 						   end of document

# Target Pseudo-class:- Selects an element whose ID attribute value matches that of the URI fragment 							identifier

	section:target {...}

    <section id="hello">...</section>

# Empty Pseudo-class:- allows elements that do not contain children or text nodes to be selected. 

    div:empty {...} 

    <div><!-- No Content--></div>

# Negation Pseudo-class:- Selects an element not represented by the stated argument.
